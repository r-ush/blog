# Hardware

My laptop is a Asus Tuf fx505. 16GB Memory, 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD, Nvidia GEFORCE GTX 1650.

The other stuff on the desk includes:

- Monitor: Samsung. I used to drool over multi-monitor setups before but I just decided to get one monitor for now (this one is 21"). It is an IPS display, with the same 16:9 aspect ratio as my laptop. So doesnt look very different on both the screens

- Mouse: [Asus Espada GT200 Gaming Mouse](https://www.amazon.in/Espada-GT200-Wired-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B079YX9MG4)

- Keyboard: [Keychron K2 V-2](https://keychron.in/product/keychron-k2-v-2/). I upgraded to a hotswap one with brown switches after my old loud one has some issue in warranty.

- Headphones: [Sony WH-1000XM3](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3). Best purchase ever. Picked it up for a great discount recently. They are really comfortable to wear for 3-4 hours of continuous usage and the noise cancelling is just magical.

- Mousepad: [ASUS GM50](https://www.flipkart.com/asus-gm50-mousepad/p/itmf9fhpxpyagyrg)

- iPad Mini 5: I also have an iPad mini 5, I mostly use it for reading and writing with the apple pencil.

- Cannon 800D - Super cool, bang for buck camera. I have it since 2017 and I love it.

# Software

I run Manjaro which suits my laptop and doesn't break everyday without me touching it.

I use i3 as my window manager. i3 gives me more customizability than regolith and its all in my hand, so like it.

Some of the applications I use daily:

- Browser: Brave.
- Music Player: Spotify.
- Notes: Notion & Apple notes.
- Editor: VSCode & nvim.
- Terminal: Alacritty with zsh and tmux.
