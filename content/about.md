# Hi there

My name is Aarush, you'll find me on the internet by `sloorush`, Previously `_r_ush_` or `r-ush`. I am writing this blog to mostly document about things i learn, so that i can look back later on.

I love messing around with my linux setup and distro hopping. Do some development at times :')

Currently working/learning blockchain and bitcoin stuff and some system design too. True centralization vs decentralization, gotta learn it all anyways.

fav font - firacode

So, there you have it... enjoy!
