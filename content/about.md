# Hi there

My name is Aarush, you'll find me on the internet by `sloorush`. I am writing this blog to mostly document about things i learn, so that i can look back later on.

I love messing around with my linux setup and distro hopping :')

Mostly exploring tehc or trying to find something new to eat.

So, there you have it... enjoy!
