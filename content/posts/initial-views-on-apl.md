Part 1 of this series in which I will rate all the programming languages as I try them.

## Initial views

I really love the ideology behind the language. You have to read the introduction of the book I have mentioned below.

Disclaimer: I have only been doing APL for a week or so when writing this blog. I will continue this blog as I progress.

## How I am learning this language


My general approach to learning a new language is to learn some basic statements and then get hands to build or practice something.

So that is an approach I am following for APL.

### The book

I am reading [Learning APL](https://xpqz.github.io/learnapl/intro.html) by @xpqz.

This book is packed with some beautiful quotes and a very interesting approach and writing to teach APL.

### The practice

I am solving https://problems.tryapl.org/ which has questions from previous APL competitions.
