mmm, it is my blog. I can talk about anything I want, read it if you want to or don't idk. I really don't think anyone ever reads anything I write so if you do please drop a text or an email. Thanks.

So I am trying to start this new informal series of blogs in which I talk about my experience of learning new programming languages.

First blog is going to be about my initial views on learning APL. APL is an array based programing language very different than your normal everyday programing languages.

- Here is post 1: [Initial views on APL](/posts/initial-views-on-apl/)
